Have you ever wondered how much sugar is in your favorite cereal?

Yeah, you could check the nutrition facts on the side of the box. But here's a site that let's you find out on the internet (technology, man... ain't it something?). 

Visit the site at michaelfrancoeur.com/thecerealconspiracy, enter a cereal (or any food, honestly), and get the sugar content per serving (TA-DA!).

Built with a dash of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, and a sprinkling of D3.
